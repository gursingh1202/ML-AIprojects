# Machine Learning and AI Projects

This repository hosts a collection of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects. Each project is organized into its own folder with relevant documentation and code.

## Healthcare Research
**Folder Location:** `Healthcare_research`

### Project Files:
- `Report.docx`: Comprehensive research report on stroke prediction
- `healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv`: Dataset used for analysis and model development
- `ml_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model implementation

### Project Overview:
This project explores the prediction of stroke occurrence in individuals, focusing on various factors such as health history, demographic information, and lifestyle choices. The goal is to predict the likelihood of stroke based on these attributes.

### Programming Language:
- **Python**

### Required Libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `os`
- `scikit-learn`
- `drive`

### Usage Instructions:
1. Upload the dataset (`healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv`) to your Google Drive.
2. Open the `ml_model.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or a Jupyter environment.
3. Execute the code cells sequentially to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model training.
